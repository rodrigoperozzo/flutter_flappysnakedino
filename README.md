# Flutter FlappySnakeDino

The idea was to code three classic games in one full application: Flappy Bird, Snake and Chrome Dino.

Currently, there's only Flappy Bird, but I am satisfied for now. I've learned what I could from this.

This is a follow up project on one of the first full app tutorials I did when starting Flutter.
